This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for invalid request data in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, vulnerable to crashes if the request body is missing or malformed. The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, adds comprehensive checks to mitigate this vulnerability and provide informative error responses.
